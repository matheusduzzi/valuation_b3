The Brazilian stock exchange currently comprises 574 tickers as listed on the website https://lnkd.in/d6Kd43e6.

Thus, as it is unfeasible to follow each one of these tickers separately, looking for each one and analyzing its indicators separately.

With that in mind, I built a crawler that captures data from Status Invest and Yahoo Finance, calculates the "fair price" of each stock by Gordon's Model, and finally, periodically returns me if that stock hit a price below the calculated one.

As an appetizer of this feat, I leave the code for the Status Invest crawler in this repo :)
